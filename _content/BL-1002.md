Including Comments
//

let
Similar to const, however, let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.
Data Types
var age = 23
Numbers
var x
Variables
var a = "init"
Text (strings)
var b = 1 + 2 + 3
Operations
var c = true
True or false statements
const PI = 3.14
Constant numbers
var name = {firstName:"John", lastName:”Doe"}
Objects
Objects
var person = {
firstName:"John",
lastName:"Doe",
age:20,
nationality:"German"
};


```

indexOf()

join()
Combine elements of an array into a single string and return the string
lastIndexOf()
Gives the last position at which a given element appears in an array
pop()
Removes the last element of an array
push()
Add a new element at the end
reverse()

!== Not equal value or not equal type
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
? Ternary operator
Logical Operators
&& Logical and
|| Logical or
! Logical not
Bitwise Operators
& AND statement
| OR statement
~ NOT
^ XOR
<< Left shift
>> Right shift
>>> Zero fill right shift

```
## Functions  {#Functions}

```
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
// what the function does
}
Outputting Data
alert()
Output data in an alert box in the browser window
confirm()
Opens up a yes/no dialog and returns true/false depending on user click

decodeURIComponent()
Decodes a URI component
encodeURI()
Encodes a URI into UTF-8
encodeURIComponent()
Same but for URI components
eval()
Evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string
isFinite()
Determines whether a passed value is a finite number
isNaN()
Determines whether a value is NaN or not
Number()
Returns a number converted from its argument
parseFloat()
Parses an argument and returns a floating point number
parseInt()
Parses its argument and returns an integer


```

## Loops   {#Loops}

```
for (before loop; condition for loop; execute after loop) {
// what to do during the loop
}
for
The most common way to create a loop in Javascript
while

continue
Skip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met
