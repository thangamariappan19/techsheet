## Main root {#Main-root}

```
<html> … </html>
The HTML <html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it 
is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element. 
Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>...</head>
 <body>...</body>
</html> 
```

## Document metadata {#Document-metadata}

```
<head> … </head>
The HTML <head> element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the 
document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. 
<link>
The HTML External Resource Link element (<link>) specifies relationships between the current 
document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets, 
but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen 
and apps on mobile devices) among other things. 
<meta>
The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML 
meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title> 
<style> … </style>
The HTML <style> element contains style information for a document, or part of a document. 
<title> … </title>
The HTML Title element (<title>) defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title 
bar or a page's tab. 

Example: 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>...</head>
 <body>...</body>
</html> 
```

## Sectioning root  {#Sectioning-root}

```
<body> … </body>
The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only 
one <body> element in a document. 
Example: 
<html>
 <head>
 <title>Document title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <p>This is a paragraph</p>
 </body>
</html>
```

## Content sectioning  {#Content-sectioning}

```
<address> … </address>
The HTML <address> element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information 
for a person or people, or for an organization. 
<article> … </article>
The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, 
application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in 
syndication). 
<aside> … </aside>
The HTML <aside> element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly 
related to the document's main content. 
<footer> … </footer>
The HTML <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning 
root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright 
data or links to related documents. 

<header> … </header>
The HTML <header> element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory 
or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an 
author name, and other elements. 
<h1> to <h6> … </h6>
The HTML <h1>–<h6> elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest 
section level and <h6> is the lowest. 
<main> … </main>
The HTML <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. The 
main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central 
topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application. 
<nav> … </nav>
The HTML <nav> element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide 
navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples 
of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes. 
<section> … </section>
The HTML <section> element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more 
specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document. 
Example: 
<address>
 <a href="mailto:jim@rock.com">jim@rock.com</a><br>
 <a href="tel:+13115552368">(311) 555-2368</a>
</address>
```

## Text content {#Text-content}

```
<blockquote> … </blockquote>
The HTML <blockquote> Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the 
enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see 
Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite 
attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element. 
<dd> … </dd>
The HTML <dd> element provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term 
(<dt>) in a description list (<dl>).
<div> … </div>
The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no 
effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS. 
<dl> … </dl>
The HTML <dl> element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of 
terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). 
Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of 
key-value pairs). 
<dt> … </dt>
The HTML <dt> element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be 
used inside a <dl> element. 
<figcaption> … </figcaption>
The HTML <figcaption> or Figure Caption element represents a caption or legend describing 
the rest of the contents of its parent <figure> element.
<figure> … </figure>
The HTML <figure> (Figure With Optional Caption) element represents self-contained content, 
potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the (<figcaption>) element. 
<hr>
The HTML <hr> element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for 
example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section. 
<li> … </li>
The HTML <li> element is used to represent an item in a list. 
<ol> … </ol>
The HTML <ol> element represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered 
list. 
<p> … </p>
The HTML <p> element represents a paragraph. 
<pre> … </pre>
The HTML <pre> element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as 
written in the HTML file. 
<ul> … </ul>
The HTML <ul> element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted 
list. 
Examples: 
<dl>
 <dt>Denim (semigloss finish)</dt>
 <dd>Ceiling</dd>

 <dt>Denim (eggshell finish)</dt>
 <dt>Evening Sky (eggshell finish)</dt>
 <dd>Layered on the walls</dd>
</dl>
<figure>
 <img src="/media/examples/elephant-660-480.jpg"
 alt="Elephant at sunset">
 <figcaption>An elephant at sunset</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol>
 <li>Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
 <li>In another bowl, mix eggs, milk, and oil.</li>
 <li>Stir both mixtures together.</li>

## Inline text semantics  {#Inline-text-semantics}

```
<a> … </a>
The HTML <a> element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web 
pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. 
<abbr> … </abbr>
The HTML Abbreviation element (<abbr>) represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional 
title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation. 
<br>
The HTML <br> element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a 
poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant. 
<cite> … </cite>
The HTML Citation element (<cite>) is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and 
must include the title of that work. 

<code> … </code>
The HTML <code> element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the 
text is a short fragment of computer code. 
<em> … </em>
The HTML <em> element marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be 
nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis. 
<mark> … </mark>
The HTML Mark Text element (<mark>) represents text which is marked or highlighted for 
reference or notation purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or importance in the 
enclosing context. 
<small> … </small>
The HTML <small> element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal 
text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size 
small, such as from small to x-small. 
<span> … </span>
The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not 
inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the 
class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. 
<strong> … </strong>
The HTML Strong Importance Element (<strong>) indicates that its contents have strong 
importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type. 
<time> … </time>
The HTML <time> element represents a specific period in time. 
Examples: 
<blockquote>
 <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking
thirteen.</p>
 <footer>
 First sentence in <cite><a
href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/0.html"><em>Nineteen
Eighty-Four</em></a></cite> by George Orwell (Part 1, Chapter 1).
 </footer>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to style your
<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
```

## Image and multimedia  {#Image-and-multimedia}

```
<audio> … </audio>
The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one 
or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element: the 
browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, 
using a MediaStream. 
<img>
The HTML <img> element embeds an image into the document. 
<track>
The HTML <track> element is used as a child of the media elements <audio> and <video>. It 
lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle 
subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) — Web Video Text Tracks or 
Timed Text Markup Language (TTML). 
<video> … </video>
The HTML Video element (<video>) embeds a media player which supports video playback into 
the document. You can use <video> for audio content as well, but the <audio> element may 
provide a more appropriate user experience. 
Examples: 
<img class="fit-picture"
 src="/media/examples/grapefruit-slice-332-332.jpg"
 alt="Grapefruit slice atop a pile of other slices">
<figure>
 <figcaption>Listen to the T-Rex:</figcaption>
 <audio
 controls
 src="/media/examples/t-rex-roar.mp3">
 Your browser does not support the
 <code>audio</code> element.
 </audio>
</figure>
<video controls width="250"
 src="/media/examples/friday.mp4">
 <track default kind="captions"
 srclang="en" 
 src="/media/examples/friday.vtt"/>
 Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. 
```
## Scripting  {#Scripting}

```
<script> … </script> 
The HTML <script> element is used to embed or reference executable code; this is typically 
used to embed or refer to JavaScript code.

two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data. 
<tbody> … </tbody>
The HTML Table Body element (<tbody>) encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements),

<thead> … </thead>
The HTML <thead> element defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table. 
<tr> … </tr>
The HTML <tr> element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established 
using a mix of <td> (data cell) and <th> (header cell) elements. 
Example: 
<table>
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th colspan="2">The table header</th>
 </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
 <tr>
 <td>The table body</td>
 <td>with two columns</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody>
</table> 
```
## Forms   {#Forms}

of items in an HTML document. 
<progress> … </progress>
The HTML <progress> element displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a 
task, typically displayed as a progress bar. 
<select> … </select>
The HTML <select> element represents a control that provides a menu of options 
<textarea> … </textarea>
The HTML <textarea> element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when 
you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment 
on a review or feedback form.
